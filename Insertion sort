;6502 ASM sorting algorithm (insertion sort) By: JackTheGripper. Sorts greatest to least. Only works in 6502js simulator by Skilldrick https://github.com/skilldrick/6502js. (monitor $0000 to $00ff to see array in memory.)

; I will comment the rest of this another day

ArrayGenerate: ;fills memory with an array of random 8 bit values.

ldx $fe
stx $00,Y
iny
cpy #$40 ;change this value to change array size
bne ArrayGenerate
jmp sortsetup

sortsetup: ;makes sure both X and Y registers are sex to 0 and jumps to sort subroutine.

ldx #$00
ldy #$00
jmp sort

sort: ;compares current byte with one to left of it.

cpx #$3f ;Set this to one less than array size.
beq done
lda $01,X
cmp $00,X
beq noswap
bcs noswap
jmp swapcheck

noswap:
inx
jmp sort

swapcheck:
stx $0102
ldx $00
cpx $0103
ldx $0102
beq more
inx
stx $0101
dex
jmp more

more:
sta $0100
lda $00,X
sta $01,X
lda $0100
sta $00,X
lda $00,X
dex
cmp $00,X
bcs jmpback
jmp more

jmpback:
inx
ldx $0101
jmp sort

done:
nop
jmp done
